# ResNet18-Pruning-Performance
This project compares fine-grained vs. channel-level pruning on ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10 at pruning ratios 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5. Fine-grained pruning retains accuracy but lacks structured sparsity, while channel-level pruning improves efficiency but degrades accuracy. The study explores trade-offs between accuracy and computational performance.
